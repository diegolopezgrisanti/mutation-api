# MUTATION API

This is the API for the MUTATION APP project, an app where you can check mutations.

This project uses a MongoDB database and it's developed using NodeJS and Express.

## Installation

Download this repository and run npm install to install the project's dependencies.

```
git clone git@github.com:diegolopezgrisanti/mutation-api.git
cd mutation-api
npm install

```

Then, you need to configure the .env file. Use the .env.example file as an example to create a .env file on the project's root folder

After you have configured the .env file and imported the database, you are ready to start the server running npm run start:dev on your terminal

```
npm run start:dev
```

The server will be running on http://localhost:3000 (unless you set a different port on your .env file)
